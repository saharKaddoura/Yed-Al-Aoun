what is the most important thing these days? absolutely YES! It is Education, we care about the children's and even the youth's future. And the first step to build a future is to learn. So in our turn, we teach the drop-out students from zero to ten, the basic materials such as English, Arabic and math. We let them know how to read and write, so they can take the next step of their lives and continue to learn in any other fild which let them work in it and build their future.
The importance of education is evident when it comes to being self-dependent. If we are we educated, then it’s something that belongs to us, and only us, allowing us to rely on no one else other than ourselves. It can allow you to not only be financially independent, but also to make your own choices.
Additionally, An education is the most powerful weapon you can possibly have, and with it, you can make all of your dreams come true. If you can dream it, you can achieve it. There are of course certain exceptions, depending on what you’re aiming for, but generally an education will take you as far as you’re willing to go
